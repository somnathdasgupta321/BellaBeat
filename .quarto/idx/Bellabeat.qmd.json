Throughout this journey I've accumulated lots of interesting, insightful and most importantly, useful information about various tools that were included with the bundle, such as Tableau, R programming, SQL, Spreadsheets.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nThis curriculum not only exposed me to diverse standardized practices, but also equipped me with a universal framework that I could apply to any project. Moreover, I gained valuable knowledge of key data analyst terminologies and processes. Through the completion of a case study included in the course, I was able to further enhance my skills and understanding by utilizing a variety of tools, methods, and strategies. Further, I will provide a brief walk through of my thought process and overall comprehension that I have developed over time through this case study.\n\n</p>\n\n## BACKGROUND INFORMATION {style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nBellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer that manufactures health-focused smart products for women.They develop uniquely beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Their app and multiple smart devices are the source point to collect various data on activity, sleep, stress, hydration levels, and reproductive health to empower women with an understanding of their own health and habits.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nBellabeat was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur and since then it has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.It took them three years to open multiple offices around the world and launch various products.They increased their product's availability through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e - commerce channel on their [website](https://bellabeat.com/){preview-link=\"true\"}.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nBellabeat offers a range of products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle, all of which connect to the Bellabeat app.There are different product lines available, but one of their popular products is the Leaf, a wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. It tracks the user's activity, sleep, and stress levels and syncs with the Bellabeat app.Apart from their products, they also offer a subscription-based membership program that provides personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness, based on users' lifestyles and goals, with 24/7 access.\n\n</p>\n\n## DATA LIMITATIONS {style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nWe have identified several limitations in the datasets. First and foremost, the data is not comprehensive, as it includes inputs from only 33 unique users. Of these 33 users, only 8 entered weight, 12 entered heart rate, and 24 entered sleep data. Furthermore, some users did not provide information for all variables in the weight dataset, making the data incomplete. Despite these limitations, we will still work with these datasets as they contain important variables.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nIt's important to note that the data comes from FitBit users, which is a secondary source, and therefore may not accurately reflect the behavior and data distribution of BellaBeat users, potentially leading to inaccurate insights.Another limitation is that the data is not current, as it was collected between 4/12/2016 to 5/12/2016, which was about 5 years prior to the time of this case study.The limited duration of data collection, only 30 days, and the small number of users, 33, also affect the reliability and may have resulted in a biased dataset.Some users may not have entered information, while others may have turned off their devices or not used them regularly. Additionally, some data was manually entered, such as weight information, which introduces potential errors.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nIf this were a real-life project intended to define BellaBeat's marketing strategy, these limitations would need to be addressed before proceeding with the analysis. However, as this is a case study and we cannot control these limitations, we will still proceed with the analysis.In a real-world scenario, a data analyst would ask several questions before proceeding with data cleaning, such as why some users generated more data rows than others, whether users contributed data voluntarily or were told how often to use the app, and what measures were taken to eliminate sampling bias. It would also be beneficial to obtain newer versions of these datasets or similar datasets directly from BellaBeat for comparison and originality.\n\n</p>\n\n## [ASK PHASE:]{data-incremental=\"\" style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\nSome of the determining questions asked which will significantly guide the direction for the future marketing program:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\n-   Do you have any specific recommendations for any selective domain or devices that you consider essential to focus on while recommending a marketing strategy?\n-   What kinds of targets or expectations have you set for this analysis? Do you mind giving a concise brief?\n-   Are you willing to pivot your business strategy if this analysis reveals insights that could help you expand your customer base and improve the customer experience apart from high level recommendation for marketing strategy?\n-   Can you identify any products that did not receive the desired response, as compared to stakeholders expectations? If so, could you provide a short brief of what you think went wrong?\n-   What will be the use case for recommending a high-level marketing strategy? Is it to enhance your current services or products, or perhaps to launch a new product or service offering?\n\n</ul>\n\n### Key Takeways {style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<ul style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\n1.  Identify business task.\n\n-   The main purpose of this analysis is to recommend a high-level marketing strategy and provide insights, which will enable the executive team to gain a clear landscape of the current state and identify untapped opportunities for growth.\n-   The analysis of any one product can result in either minor or significant changes to that product or the creation of a new product that enhances the overall female customers experience as well as, can increase retention rates.\n\n2.  Consider Key Stakeholders.\n\n-   Urška Sršen(Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer).\n-   Sando Mur(Mathematician and Bellabeat's cofounder)\n-   Marketing Analytics Team.\n\n</ul>\n\n### Deliverables {style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<ul style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\n-   Our goal is to ascertain growth opportunities for any specific products or services, as well as unlock the full potential of female customers who avail themselves of these offerings.\n-   The aim is to spot all determining factors which are hindering female customers from achieving a balanced lifestyle through use of the app and also undermining possibilities for improving the app's services to a superior standard.\n\n</ul>\n\n## [PREPARE PHASE:]{data-incremental=\"\" style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-justify\">\n\nIn this analysis, I will be using datasets to identify every pattern and style in how female users are utilizing the availed services or products. This analysis can also help broadcast areas where the product or service may need improvement or where the marketing strategies can be optimized to better cater to the needs and preferences of female users.The data is made available using public domain by Mobius [page](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic){preview-link=\"true\"}.\n\n</p>\n\n### Key Task {style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<ul style=\"font-size: 100%;

font-family: Century;\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\nThis extensively crucial phase of strategizing the new marketing campaign will be carried out by Urška Sršen(Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer),Sando Mur(Mathematician and Bellabeat's cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team) and Bellabeat marketing team based on the conclusion of the above analysis made.\n\n</p>\n\n## [CONCLUSION:]{data-incremental=\"\" style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<ul style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\n-   The relationship between total time asleep and total time in bed appears to be quite linear. Nevertheless, some users sleep for more than 10 hours and spend over 12 hours in bed, which results in an unhealthy sleep cycle.\n-   The distance covered by each female user appears to be more active during weekends, particularly on Saturdays and Sundays, compared to other weekdays. Additionally, it varies from month to month. Out of the two months' data available, Thursday and Tuesday recorded the lowest distance covered by female users for the month of May.\n-   The co-relation of total steps walked every weekday in a month appear to be similar with the distance covered by each user. This suggests that most calories are burned through walking, irrespective of any other exercises.\n-   Based on two-month data, one interesting insight is that the maximum amount of calories on a daily basis were burned by women users during the month of April, whereas the lowest sum of calories was burned during the month of May.\n-   The data shows that active weekdays for calories burned on a minute-by-minute and hourly basis almost follows a linear pattern, with Friday, Saturday, Thursday, and Tuesday being the peak weekdays compared to the rest of the week.\n-   The correlogram of total time asleep, and total time in bed clearly indicates a positive relationship between them.However, sedentary minutes have a negative relationship with both total time asleep and time in bed. Additionally, the distribution of sedentary minutes is bimodal.These findings suggest that increasing time spent asleep and in bed may be beneficial for overall health, while reducing sedentary behavior could also have a positive impact on day to day life.\n-   The correlogram of weight in pounds and BMI reveals a clear positive relationship between these variables, while sedentary minutes exhibit a negative relationship with both weight and BMI. These findings suggest that reducing sedentary behavior could help maintain a balanced weight and BMI.\n-   The pie chart clearly shows that sedentary minutes percentage are comparatively much higher than the rest of the segments, such as very active minutes, fairly active minutes and lightly active minutes, which shows that users were very minimally active.\n-   The second pie chart reveals that lightly active distance contribute almost 50% of total segments followed by very active and moderate distance.However, sedentary distance is almost negligible as compared to all three segments.\n-   Among the three categories of distance covered by each female user, the average distance for very active distance is 1.39km, the moderate distance is 0.73km, while in comparison with the light active distance, which is much higher at 3.53km. These findings suggest that female users engaged in a variety of physical activity levels, with light activity being the most common and highest in distance.\n\n</ul>\n\n## [DELIVERABLE:]{data-incremental=\"\" style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<ul style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\n-   Allocate data engineers to focus on collecting a diverse range of health data while maintaining data integrity and by enabling integration of data science into bellabeat resulting in personalized push notifications based on individual health parameters.\n-   Integrating data science can help curate a comprehensive understanding of their health and wellness that in turn can guide them towards more informed decisions about their lifestyle choices and improve their overall well-being.Thus making the app a more effective tool for achieving health and wellness goals.\n-   An effective way to get weight info is to first partner with any weight scale manufacturer to develop a smart weight scale digital solution to get the precise weight readings.It is one of the crucial parameters which will help nutritionists or algorithms to provide personalized and accurate guidance. Also, by leveraging this data, the overall experience for achieving health and wellness goals can be enhanced more effectively.\n-   To create a more engaging experience for our users, we could develop a community feature that allows them to connect with friends from their contacts, social media accounts, or directly within the app. By leveraging social connections, we can boost user engagement and increase screen time on the app.\n-   Bellabeat app can be an essential part of our users' daily routine by integrating additional features that help them plan their day. Along with that, it could include an alarm option that alerts them to attend scheduled tasks throughout the day. Additionally, we could host weekly and monthly challenges that are open to users from any location, and offer rewards such as discount coupons or free product or service subscriptions for those who complete the challenges. These features will not only enhance the user experience, but also encourage them to use the app regularly and make healthier choices as part of their daily lifestyle.\n-   To help users improve their sleep cycle, we can add extensions to the app that provide default notifications for getting into bed and waking up on time. This can be achieved by incorporating heart rate sensors that detect the user's sleep time and provide alerts accordingly. These features will not only promote better sleep habits, but also enhance the user experience by providing personalized notifications based on their individual sleep patterns.\n-   To reduce sedentary minutes, it is essential to add an extra feature that enables users to drink water after every half an hour to stay hydrated. Additionally,if a user has been sedentary for two or three hours, remind the user to take a short walk in order to make them more active and productive throughout the day.By incorporating these features, users can stay motivated to stay active and healthy, leading to a more balanced lifestyle.\n-   To reduce total time in bed, bellabeat can add an additional feature to the sleep cycle feature that prompts users with a notification to fall asleep if they are awake in bed for an extended period of time. Additionally, Bellabeat can partner with a software company that produces meditation and sleep time stories and integrate subscription packages within its annual or monthly packages. This can help users to get a complete bundle of health and calmness along with a push to fall asleep early, thus reducing total time in bed.\n-   Expand your user base by enabling referral benefits such as giving both users the benefit of a 50% - 50% discount on annual subscriptions, or else providing any subscription to any product.Other than that, another extra feature can be added by creating a bellabeat, secure wallet service where users can earn coins on referrals plus gets rewarded for every challenge they participate and then can spent it on any bellabeat products or services purchases made in any near future.\n\n</ul>\n\n## [RESOURCES:]{data-incremental=\"\" style=\"font-family: Century;\"}\n\n<ul style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: Century\" class=\"reveal-text-center\">\n\n-   Stack overflow [\\[Link\\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions){preview-link=\"true\"}.\n-   RStudio Community[\\[Link\\]](https://community.rstudio.com/){preview-link=\"true\"}.\n-   RPubs[\\[Link\\]](https://rpubs.com/){preview-link=\"true\"}.\n-   Kaggle [\\[Link\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/){preview-link=\"true\"}.\n-   National Library Of Medicine [\\[Link\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355403/){preview-link=\"true\"}.\n\n</ul>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":true,"toc-depth":2,"embed-resources":true,"highlight-style":"github","self-contained":true,"css":["style.css"],"output-file":"Bellabeat.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","title":"Case Study on Bellabeat","subtitle":"A Health Focused High-Tech Manufacturer","author":"By Somnath Das Gupta","editor_options":{"chunk_output_type":"inline"},"editor":"visual","number-depth":3,"toc-style":"sidebar","toc-location":"left","toc-title":"Contents","smooth-scroll":true,"code-copy":true,"comments":false,"code-block-bg":true,"code-block-border-left":"#31BAE9"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
